# 📚 Books-API

Heyyy! Welcome to **my epic Books-API** 😎✨  
I’m Mariya, a 17-year-old book nerd who loves reading, writing, and coding (yes, I do it all). I built this little project to play around with Node.js and Express, and honestly… it’s kinda awesome. Oh, and fun fact: I’ve got **two books of my own** that are still waiting to be published… but hehe, I won’t tell you anything more right now 😉📖

## ⚡ What This API Does

This API is basically your **ultimate book manager**. You can do all the cool stuff:

- **GET /books** - See all the books chilling in the list  
- **GET /books/:id** - Check out one book individually (because every book deserves its spotlight)  
- **POST /books** - Add a book like a true author or librarian  
- **PUT /books/:id** - Update a book if you accidentally wrote the wrong title (oops)  
- **DELETE /books/:id** - Delete a book (RIP little buddy 😢)

> ⚠️ Note: This API doesn’t use a database yet, so all your books live in memory. That means they disappear when the server stops. Boohoo! But hey, it’s perfect for testing and fun experiments.

## 🛠 Tools I Used

- **Node.js** - The magic behind the scenes  
- **Express** - Makes APIs super easy and cool  
- **Postman** - To try out all the endpoints like a pro
